Palindrome Detector
A palindrome is any word, phrase, or sentence that reads the same forward and backward. Here are some well-known palindromes:

Able was I, ere I saw Elba
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama
Desserts, I stressed
Kayak
Racecar
tacocat

Write a boolean method that uses recursion to determine whether a String argument is a palindrome. The method should return true if the argument reads the same forward and backward. Demonstrate the method in a program.
